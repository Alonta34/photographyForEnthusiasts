# Photography For Enthusiasts

You just got your first camera and you're not sure what to get for it. Or maybe you dont even have a camera but you're
into photography. Well that's what this project is for. The inspiration for this project stems from my interest in photography
and how I wasnt quite sure where to start. The goal for this project is to inspire amatures and beginners alike, to provide a 
simple list of photography products, and to provide shooting locations. There will be 4 pages to this site, the home page which will consist of 
a moderate photo gallery, a supplies page for all of the available items,the locations page to see different shooting spots, and the cart page 
where the user should be able to view their selected products.


 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how 
your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The main purpose of this website is to provide inspiration to new and returning users as well as providing a simple 
means for which the user can view and or purchase cameras and camera gear should they wish. To achieve these goals, the wedsite
is broken down into 4 pages which can easily be distinguished via the tabs at the top of the page which will lead the users to
the respective areas of the site upon clicking them. These pages include a gallery, a map, and supplies page to showcase different 
equipment to choose from.  


- As a new user, I want to be able to easily navigate the website's gallery and map section
- As a new user, I want to be able to click on the footer links and they take me to their designated sites
- As a general user, I want to be able to zoom in and out on locations on the map
- As a general or new user, I want the 'add to cart' links to add items to the cart
- As a general user, I want my cart item count to be seen on the site
- As a general user, I want the check out button to complete my purchase

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
